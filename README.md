# Data Science Techniques in Finance

Here are examples of python implementations of data science models and approaches in finance. We can use them as cheat sheets in our work.

The following approaches are covered (briefly):

* Value at risk (VaR): VaR calculation using Variance-Covariance approach, Historical Simulation approach, Monte Carlo approach;
* Expected Shortfall (ES), also known as Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR);
* The Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model;
* The Black-Scholes model;
* Copula Models;
* Stress testing techniques: Historical Simulation approach, Scenario Analysis approach, Monte Carlo Simulation, Sensitivity Analysis, Reverse Stress Testing, Machine Learning Techniques (classical models + LSTM);
* Model validation techniques commonly used in machine learning: Holdout Validation, Cross-Validation, Stratified Sampling, Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV), Time Series Cross-Validation, Bootstrap Validation, Nested Cross-Validation, Randomized Search Cross-Validation, Hold-One-Out Validation, Validation Curve;
* Some techniques commonly used for validating financial risk models: Backtesting, Stress Testing, Scenario Analysis, Out-of-Sample Testing, Model Comparison, Sensitivity Analysis;
* `yfinance` library (Python) for retrieving financial data;
* `PyPortfolioOpt` library;
* The Sharpe Ratio, The Beta coefficient, the risk-return profile;
* Global Minimum Variance and Maximum Sharpe Ratio Portfolios;
* Portfolio Optimization via Monte Carlo Method
* Tail Risk Analysis;
* Statistical tests for normality (Anderson-Darling, Shapiro-Wilk, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov).
